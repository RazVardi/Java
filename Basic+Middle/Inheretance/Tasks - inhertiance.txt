Homework - Inherited

Basic level exercises
Exercise 1: Inheritance (Class Heir of Class)
1. Build your own project that defines the following hierarchy.
2. Build a class named Person that contains the following variables:
a. String name
b. String email
c. long birthYear
d. All standard methods (constructor / setter / getter)
e. A method that prints the person's data as printInfo
f. We will define a toString method
3. Build a class called Student that inherits (extends) from Person and in addition contains the following variables:
a. String courseName
b. boolean active
c. All standard methods (constructor / setter / getter)
d. A method that prints the student's data (including being human) called printInfo
4. Start 3 different students with all their parameters in the array.
5. Print out all the information about each student


Exercise 2: Inheritance (Class Heir of Class)
1. Build a project that defines the following hierarchy:
2. Build a class called Vehicle that contains the following variables:
a. int year
b. double price
c. String color
d. All standard methods (constructor / setter / getter)
e. A method that prints Vehicle data called printInfo
f. In addition, we will define a toString method
  3. Build a class called Car that inherits (extends) from Vehicle and in addition contains the following variable:
int numberOfDoors .a
b. All standard methods (constructor / setter / getter)
c. A method that prints Car data (including being a Vehicle) called printInfo
d. In addition, we will define a toString method
4. Build a class called Truck that inherits (extends) from Vehicle and in addition contains the following variable:
int numberOfAxlesa .a
    b. All standard methods (constructor / setter / getter)
             c. A method that prints Car data (including being a Vehicle) called printInfo
            d. In addition, we will define a toString method
5. Build a class called Motorcycle that extends from Vehicle and also contains the following variable:
  boolean hasSideCar.a
b. All standard methods (constructor / setter / getter)
c. A method that prints the Motorcycle data (including being a Vehicle) called printInfo
d. In addition, we will define a toString method
6. From the main function you will create objects for Car, Truck, Motorcycle
7. Print the information for each of them using printInfo and toString methods.





Intermediate level exercises
Exercise 3: Inheritance (Class Heir from Class) - Several levels of inheritance - Build a project that defines the following hierarchy, according to the definition of classes that will maintain this system:








Adhere to the following logic:
1. Animal Class implements howDoYouLive method The method prints:
 I breath oxygen
And the following variables: color, name
2. From the main function, create an Anaconda object and make sure that it responds to the call in this method howDoYouLive.
3. In Animal Class you will write a function called howManyLegs that prints:
 this question is too general
In Gorilla and Anaconda classes you will implement the howManyLegs function and print a correct answer for each animal according to what it has.
5. Make sure that both Gorrila's and anaconda's Instance each return the correct (and different) answer to this question.
Define another animal - an heir from either Monkey or Snake who will answer this question.
