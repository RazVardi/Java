collections + exceptions - Homework
Basic level exercises
Exercise 1:
Set up a String ArrayList collection
ArrayList <String> listOfCountries = new ArrayList <String> ();
2. Add to the list several names of countries: israel, usa, japan, mexico, australia
3. Print the list in a loop
4. Sort the list (you can use the sort function (search on Google) built into some of the list functions or call the advanced method you wrote that does sorting)
5. Print the list after sorting.

Exercise 2:
1. Write a collection of Integer numbers (since lists work with objects and not with primitive variables then Integer should be used which is basically a class that contains a number and other methods)
ArrayList <Integer> list = new ArrayList <> ();
2. Add 5 numbers to it
3. Find the maximum number in the list and print it (it is advisable to call the method that returns the value)
4. Find the minimum number in the list and print it (it is advisable to call the method that returns the value)

Intermediate level exercises
Exercise 1: (Optional. Permission)
Create a country and capital hashmap.
2. HashMap <String, String> hmap = new HashMap <String, String> ();
3. Add 4 countries and their capital cities including Israel, Jerusalem
4. Ask for the capital of Israel and print it out.

Exercise 2:
Create a method that accepts Array with 6 numbers and returns ArrayList sorted,
Print the ArrayList after you receive it.



Advanced level exercises
Exercise 1:
General web search exercise and dealing with code (including exceptions)
Write a program that downloads the HTML code of a website and saves it to a file. This is possible with these functions.
URL url = new URL ("https://www.ynet.co.il");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection ();
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (conn.getInputStream ()));
Investigate these functions and if necessary help on the page http://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-get-url-content-in-java/
Then write the contents of the page to a file. You can not do without the Exceptions. Look at how this is done in the example.

Exercise 2:
The purpose of this exercise is to start helping you learn how to search on Google, and use "ready-made" code with minor modifications (including using try-catch).

A large part of the classes or methods we need, someone else has already written,
And here you are going to create objects and then run from content methods we did not learn in class by a short Google search.
Write a number of lines in a text file (.txt), including your name. And save the file.
Search Google How to read a read file in Java "read text file in java example"
It is advisable to search alone but if you have not found a good example then here I have found for you :)
Use this link https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-read-file-from-java-bufferedreader-example/
3. Now write a program that prints only the lines that contain your name (to check if String contains another String use the Contains function as in the following link http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/lang/string_contains.htm)
